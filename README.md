This was my final project for the Advanced Computer Graphics course at UCSD wherein I programmed realtime VFX. I looked at tech videos and forum posts for the game Star Citizen, and implemented their approach to fluid visualization. See below for a video. The floating crosses are watermarks due to FumeFX not having a student license. To run the program yourself, run "CSE163_A3.exe" in the project folder.

Project milestones:

• Simulated and rendered animation frames in 3ds Max with the FumeFX plugin

• Made a program that further processed the rendered frames to get alpha, diffuse, and normal maps

• Generated optical flow maps with Slate Editor

• Used OpenGL and C++ to visualize the animation, with a shader that uses the optical flow maps to blend between frames
